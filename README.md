# Subibox Jukebox: 
An [rotary dial telephone](https://github.com/equant/Rotary-Dial) and [TV](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/rca-pi-zero/) based [mpd](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD) client/jukebox built using a Raspberry Pi, and Kivy/[KivyPie](http://kivypie.mitako.eu/).

# Status

This code is starting to get someplace useful for myself.  Chances are it is
not useful to you.  This is my first Kivy project, so it is also a poor example
of how to do things with Kivy.  Should be ready in 2039.

# Requirements

Python, kivy, python-mpd2, pillow, sqlite3, a rotary dial telephone

````
$ pip install --user python-mpd2
$ pip install --user pillow
````
